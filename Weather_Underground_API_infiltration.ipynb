    "# Weather Underground API scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "I developed this code based on a tutorial located at: http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/scraping/scraping-wunderground\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather Underground API data features can be explored at: http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=data/index\n",
    "\n",
    "I generated a Weather Underground API key using my personal email account. My account is limited to something like 500 daily calls to the API and some hourly value that is not of concern. Calling each hour of the day in eight homes will lead to 8*24 = 192 daily calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the online JSON editor (http://jsoneditoronline.org/) to assist in understanding JSON formatted responses from Weather Underground API. Simply take the API call URL (in requests.get() calls) and paste into the JSON editor. This helps in constructing the calls to the JSON objects (e.g.,  data['hourly_forecast']['hour']['FCTTIME']['hour_padded']).\n",
    "\n",
    "##Description of codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are imported, custom fucntions are defined, model coefficients are initialized, API calls are made for 3-day hourly forecasts and for current conditions, infiltration is estimated for forecast and current values, forecast array is written to file for use in cases where current conditions cannot be accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Forecast portion should be executed once every 4, 8 or 12 hours.\n",
    "* Current conditions portion will be executed once per hour.\n",
    "* If current conditions calculations fail for any reason, then the forecast data table should be opened, and values should be selected based on the matching date/time index.\n",
    "* Use hourly infiltration estimate in dose/exposure and RIVEC calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that I was not able to export this .pynb file to .py script using the option under File>Download As>Python. Had to use the following at the command line (https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/1/interactive/nbconvert.html):\n",
